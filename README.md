     - **`deepseek_service.py`**: Manages API calls to DeepSeek models.  
     - **`genai_service.py`**: Handles requests to Googleâ€™s Gemini/PaLM models via Generative AI API.  
     - **`azure_service.py`**: Connects with Azure OpenAI services for model inference.  

8. **`config.py`**  
   - Stores global configuration settings, such as task types, phases, and discussion order.  
   - **Important**: Ensure to add your API key for models.  

9. **`prompts.py`**
